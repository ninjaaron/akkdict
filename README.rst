akkdict
=======
``akkdict.py`` is a simple command-line python program that takes an
akkadian word as input and opens pdfs of several akkadian dictionaries
to the right page (or somewhere thereabouts). It works well for some of
the illicit pdfs of *The Concise Dictionary of Akkdian* (CDA) and *Das
Akkadishes Handw√∂rterbuch* (AHw) floating around, if you happen to have
them. It also will get you within 100 pages in the *Assyrian Dictionary
of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago* (CAD), which can
be freely downloaded from
http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/assyrian-dictionary-oriental-institute-university-chicago-cad
if you would like to contribute to expanding and improving the CAD index
or any of the other indicies, we would be happy to pull from you! If you
are a humanities major and using git is too hard, contact me!
