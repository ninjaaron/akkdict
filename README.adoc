akkdict
-------
`akkdict.py` is a simple command-line python program that takes an
akkadian word as input and opens pdfs of several akkadian dictionaries
to the right page (or somewhere thereabouts). It works well for some of
the illicit pdfs of _The Concise Dictionary of Akkdian_ (CDA) and _Das
Akkadishes Handw√∂rterbuch_ (AHw) floating around, if you happen to have
them.  It also will get you within 100 pages in the _Assyrian Dictionary
of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago_ (CAD), which can
be freely downloaded from
http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/assyrian-dictionary-oriental-institute-university-chicago-cad
if you would like to contribute to expanding and improving the CAD index
or any of the other indicies, we would be happy to pull from you! If you
are a humanities major and using git is too hard, contact me!

dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~
`akkdict.py` requires:

- Python 3

If you are on any form of *nix, you should be able to get Python 3 from
your package manager (homebrew, on OS X). I don't know how to use
Windows but I'm sure you can get it sorted if you do a search. Unless
the Unicode stuff is batty.

installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

. Clone this repo or download and unzip the zip.
. move copies of (or make symlinks to) your akkadian dictionary PDFs in
  the `akkdict/dicts` directory. All of the volumes of the CAD should be
  in a subdirectory within this folder -- `akkdict/dicts/CAD/`, is
  default, but though you can manually set the name in the configuration
  file.
. copy the conf.ini to the file \~/.akkdictrc and edit it for your system.
  The default PDF reader is `zathura`, which is my favorite, but you will
  probably want to change that. This requires knowing how to run your PDF
  reader from the command line. Good luck! Comment out or delete any lines
  in the config file for dictionaries you don't have. You may optionally
  wish to link akkdict.py to somewhere in your PATH. Don't move the
  original file out of the akkdict folder. It will break.

Someday, this may be a package on PyPI which you can just install with
minimal configuration. Today is not that day. Good Luck!
